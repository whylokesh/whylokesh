## 🧠 About Me

Hey there! I'm a curious builder who loves creating systems, speculating on future tech, and hacking things together to see what sticks.  

I don’t just code for the sake of it. I code to **ship real stuff**, solve meaningful problems, and make tech that actually helps.  
Currently vibing with backend systems, Web3 contracts, AI agents, and whatever else feels exciting.
